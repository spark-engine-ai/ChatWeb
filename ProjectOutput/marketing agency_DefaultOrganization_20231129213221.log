We have decided to complete the task through a executable webapplication with multiple files implemented via  Next JS Tyepscript with Tailwind.. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The webapplication should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will be put inside the components folder. Keep in mind the pages/index.tsx file is already available and imports components/main.tsx so you do not have to make the index file.

You will first lay out the names of the core functions as well as list as many components that will be necessary, and also comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file with complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file to first import the other files that you will make. The "main" file is where all the components link to

Please note that the code should be fully functional, with no comments in the files and all components should have a highly detailed responsive UI design using tailwind, next js and typescript using lorem ipsum filler content unless specified.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the webapplication directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) the component is indeed using Tailwind and Next js
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated webapplication without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the import statements for the components used in the Main component. Additionally, the code does not implement the components for Home, AboutUs, and ContactForm. 

To fix this, you need to import the components in the Main component by adding the following import statements at the top of the file:

```tsx
import { AboutUs, ContactForm, Home } from './aboutus';
```

Then, make sure to implement the missing components by creating the respective files (aboutus.tsx, contactform.tsx, home.tsx) and adding the necessary code for each component.

Once you have implemented the missing components and imported them correctly, the code should be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the import statements for the components used in the Main component. Additionally, the code does not implement the components for Home, AboutUs, and ContactForm. 

To fix this, you need to import the components in the Main component by adding the following import statements at the top of the file:

```tsx
import { AboutUs, ContactForm, Home } from './aboutus';
```

Then, make sure to implement the missing components by creating the respective files (aboutus.tsx, contactform.tsx, home.tsx) and adding the necessary code for each component.

Once you have implemented the missing components and imported them correctly, the code should be ready for use."
In the webapplication, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the webapplication creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the webapplication directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) the component is indeed using Tailwind and Next js
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated webapplication without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a webapplication company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer webapplication or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: A marketing agency website that uses a aquagreen theme with subtle gradients and the header navbar should change the components like tabs which include an about us tab and a contact form tab and a home tab with different cool template sections.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statements for the components used in the Main component. To fix this, you need to add the import statements for the AboutUs, ContactForm, and Home components in the Main.tsx file.

<REVISION> Add the following import statements at the top of the Main.tsx file:

```tsx
import AboutUs from './aboutus';
import ContactForm from './contactform';
import Home from './home';
```

This will import the necessary components and fix the issue.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is missing the import statements for the components used in the Main component. To fix this, you need to add the import statements for the AboutUs, ContactForm, and Home components in the Main.tsx file.

<REVISION> Add the following import statements at the top of the Main.tsx file:

```tsx
import AboutUs from './aboutus';
import ContactForm from './contactform';
import Home from './home';
```

This will import the necessary components and fix the issue."
In the webapplication, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the webapplication creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the webapplication directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) the component is indeed using Tailwind and Next js
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated webapplication without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a webapplication company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer webapplication or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: A marketing agency website that uses a aquagreen theme with subtle gradients and the header navbar should change the components like tabs which include an about us tab and a contact form tab and a home tab with different cool template sections.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the import statements for the components `AboutUs`, `ContactForm`, and `Home` in the `main.tsx` file. This will result in an error when trying to render these components.

To fix this issue, you need to add the import statements for the missing components at the top of the `main.tsx` file. The corrected code should look like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AboutUs, ContactForm, Home } from './aboutus';

const Main: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav className="bg-aquagreen">
        <ul className="flex justify-center">
          <li className="mr-6">
            <a href="#home">Home</a>
          </li>
          <li className="mr-6">
            <a href="#about">About Us</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#contact">Contact Form</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <div id="home">
        <Home />
      </div>
      <div id="about">
        <AboutUs />
      </div>
      <div id="contact">
        <ContactForm />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Main;
```

Once you make this change, the components should be rendered correctly in the web application.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided seems to be missing the import statements for the components `AboutUs`, `ContactForm`, and `Home` in the `main.tsx` file. This will result in an error when trying to render these components.

To fix this issue, you need to add the import statements for the missing components at the top of the `main.tsx` file. The corrected code should look like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { AboutUs, ContactForm, Home } from './aboutus';

const Main: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav className="bg-aquagreen">
        <ul className="flex justify-center">
          <li className="mr-6">
            <a href="#home">Home</a>
          </li>
          <li className="mr-6">
            <a href="#about">About Us</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#contact">Contact Form</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <div id="home">
        <Home />
      </div>
      <div id="about">
        <AboutUs />
      </div>
      <div id="contact">
        <ContactForm />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Main;
```

Once you make this change, the components should be rendered correctly in the web application."
In the webapplication, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the webapplication creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
